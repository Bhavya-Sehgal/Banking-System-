      <p>A Saga of Vision and Enterprise<br>
        It has been a long and eventful journey of almost a century across 21 countries. Starting in 2015 from a small building in Banglore to its new hi-rise and hi-tech Corporate Centre in Delhi, is a saga of vision, enterprise, financial prudence and corporate governance.
      </p>
      <p>It is a story scripted in corporate wisdom and social pride. It is a story crafted in private capital, princely patronage and state ownership. It is a story of ordinary bankers and their extraordinary contribution in the ascent of Sehgal Banks Ltd to the formidable heights of corporate glory. It is a story that needs to be shared with all those millions of people - customers, stakeholders, employees & the public at large - who in ample measure, have contributed to the making of an institution.</p>
